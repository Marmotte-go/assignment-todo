# About this ToDo List

This is an assignment from Integrefy tech interview preparation

## Assignment requirements

1. Create a page (component) that displays a button that once clicked will bring up a form where the user can enter information for the todo item (title, deadline, and status - in progress, not started, or done).
2. Once the user has entered the item, dismiss the page and show the item in the list on the page.
3. If the user clicks on any items in the list, the user can edit the information of that item. 

### Hints
* Use functional react components.
* Divide the application into small components, for instance: Button, ToDoItem, and ToDoList. 
* React hooks: useState, useParams, useEffect 
* For styling: use any bootstrap or library that you feel comfortable with. Recommend MUI: https://mui.com/ 
* After finishing the project, push the code to Github, also try to deploy it to Netlify, or take a screenshot of your application. (https://www.netlify.com/ )
